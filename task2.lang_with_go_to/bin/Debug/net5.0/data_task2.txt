Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly
normal thank you very much They were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything
strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense
Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings which made drills He was a big beefy
man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache Mrs Dursley was thin
and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors The Dursleys
had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere
The Dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was
that somebody would discover it They didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about
the Potters Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact
Mrs Dursley pretended she did not have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing
husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a
small son too but they had never even seen him This boy was another good reason for keeping
the Potters away they didnt want Dudley mixing with a child like that When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke
up on the dull gray Tuesday our story starts there was
nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be
happening all over the country Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high
chair None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window
At half past eight Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and
tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed because Dudley was now having a tantrum and
throwing his cereal at the walls
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiara cat
reading a map For a second Mr Dursley didnt realize what he had seenthen he jerked his head
around to look again There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive but there wasnt a
map in sight What could he have been thinking of It must have been a trick of the light Mr
Dursley blinked and stared at the cat It stared back As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up
the road he watched the cat in his mirror It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive no
looking at the sign cats could not read maps or signs Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put
the cat out of his mind As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills
he was hoping to get that day
But on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else As he sat in the
usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about People in cloaks Mr Dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny
clothesthe getups you saw on young people He supposed this was some stupid new fashion
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos
standing quite close by They were whispering excitedly together Mr Dursley was enraged to
see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and
wearing an emeraldgreen cloak The nerve of him But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was
probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that
would be it The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings
parking lot his mind back on drills
Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor If he hadnt
he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning He didnt see the owls
swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed
openmouthed as owl after owl sped overhead Most of them had never seen an owl even at
nighttime Mr Dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning He yelled at five
different people He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more He was in a
very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road
to buy himself a bun from the bakery
He had forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers
He eyed them angrily as he passed He didnt know why but they made him uneasy This bunch
were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin It was on his way
back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they
were saying
Mr Dursley stopped dead Fear flooded him He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to
say something to them but thought better of it
He dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb
him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his
mind He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking… no he was being
stupid Potter wasnt such an unusual name He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry Come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called
Harry Hed never even seen the boy It might have been Harvey Or Harold There was no point
in worrying Mrs Dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister He didnt blame
herif hed had a sister like that… but all the same those people in cloak
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at
five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door
Sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell It was a few seconds before
Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak He didnt seem at all upset at
being almost knocked to the ground On the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said
in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare Dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could
upset me today Rejoice for YouKnowWho has gone at last Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating this happy happy day
And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off
Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot He had been hugged by a complete stranger He also
thought he had been called a Muggle whatever that was He was rattled He hurried to his car
and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because
he didnt approve of imagination
As he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he sawand it didnt improve his
moodwas the tabby cat hed spotted that morning It was now sitting on his garden wall He
was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes
Shoo said Mr Dursley loudly
The cat didnt move It just gave him a stern look Was this normal cat behavior? Mr Dursley
wondered Trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house He was still determined
not to mention anything to his wife
Mrs Dursley had had a nice normal day She told him over dinner all about Mrs Next Doors
problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word Will not Mr
He didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed While Mrs Dursley was
in the bathroom Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front
garden The cat was still there It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something
Was he imagining things Could all this have anything to do with the Potters If it did if it got
out that they were related to a pair ofwell he didnt think he could bear it
The Dursleys got into bed Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake turning it
all over in his mind His last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters
were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley The Potters knew
very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind He couldnt see how he and
Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going onhe yawned and turned over
it couldnt affect them
How very wrong he was
Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was
showing no sign of sleepiness It was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the
far corner of Privet Drive It didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next
street nor when two owls swooped overhead In fact it was nearly midnight before the cat
moved at all
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently
youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground The cats tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed Dursley
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive He was tall thin and very old judging
by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt He was
wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots His
blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very
longand crooked as though it had been broken at least twice This mans name was Albus
Dumbledore
Albus Dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything
from his name to his boots was unwelcome He was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for
something But he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter
He flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it The nearest street lamp went out with a
little pop He clicked it againthe next lamp flickered into darkness Twelve times he clicked
the PutOuter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the
distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him If anyone looked out of their window
now even beadyeyed Mrs Dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening
down on the pavement Dumbledore slipped the PutOuter back inside his cloak and set off down
the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat He didnt look at it
but after a moment he spoke to it
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her
spectacles Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and
examined it It was a very odd watch It had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets
were moving around the edge It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because he put it
back in his pocket and said Hagrids late I suppose it was he who told you Id be here by the
way
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said Yes
yes youre right of course But how is the boy getting here Dumbledore? She eyed his cloak
suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them It grew steadily louder as they
looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both
looked up at the skyand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front
of them If the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it He was almost twice as
tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide He looked simply too big to be allowed and
so wildlong tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size
of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins In his vast muscular
arms he was holding a bundle of blankets
Yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or well be found Professor
McGonagall whispered patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low
garden wall and walked to the front door He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of
his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to the other two For a full minute
the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle Hagrids shoulders shook Professor
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the
very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen Harry Potter rolled over inside his
blankets without waking up One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not
knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few
hours time by Mrs Dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles
nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley…
He couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were
holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices To Harry Potterthe boy who lived
time had passed Ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink
beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnetsbut Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby and
now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair
playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother The room held
no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too
Yet Harry Potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long His Aunt Petunia was
awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day
Dudleys birthdayhow could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started
looking for socks He found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put
them on Harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and
that was where he slept
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen The table was almost hidden
beneath all Dudleys birthday presents It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer
he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike Exactly why Dudley want
course it involved punching somebody Dudleys favorite punching bag was Harry but he
couldnt often catch him Harry didnt look it but he was very fast
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but Harry had always been small
and skinny for his age He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had
to wear were old clothes of Dudleys and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was
Harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes He wore round glasses
held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the
nose The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead
that was shaped like a bolt of lightning He had had it as long as he could remember and the first
question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it
About once a week Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry
needed a haircut Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put
together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother Dudley looked
a lot like Uncle Vernon He had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and
thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
looked like a baby angelHarry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much
room Dudley meanwhile was counting his presents His face fell
Dudleys mouth fell open in horror but Harrys heart gave a leap Every year on Dudleys
birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger
restaurants or the movies Every year Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg a mad old lady who
lived two streets away Harry hated it there The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg
made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned
Half an hour later Harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the Dursleys
car with Piers and Dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life His aunt and uncle
hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left Uncle Vernon
had taken Harry aside
Once Aunt Petunia tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt
been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for
his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry who
spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy
clothes and taped glasses Next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had
been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this even
though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly
Another time Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudleys
brown with orange puff balls The harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed
to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit Harry Aunt
Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief Harry wasnt
punished
On the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school
kitchens Dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to Harrys surprise as
anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
from Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings But all hed
tried to do as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump
behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors Harry supposed that the wind must have
caught him in midjump
But he wished he hadnt said anything If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than
his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it
was in a dream or even a cartoonthey seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families The Dursleys bought
Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the
van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap
lemon ice pop It wasnt bad either Harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its
head who looked remarkably like Dudley except that it wasnt blond
Harry had the best morning hed had in a long time He was careful to walk a little way apart
from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by
lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him They ate in the zoo restaurant
and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on
top Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first
Harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last
After lunch they went to the reptile house It was cool and dark in there with lit windows all
along the walls Behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering
over bits of wood and stone Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick
mancrushing pythons Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place It could have
wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car and crushed it into a trash canbut at the
moment it didnt look in the mood In fact it was fast asleep
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake He wouldnt have been
surprised if it had died of boredom itselfno company except stupid people drumming their
fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long It was worse than having a cupboard as a
bedroom where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at
least he got to visit the rest of the house
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes Slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes
were on a level with Harrys
Harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished The great
snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor People throughout the reptile
house screamed and started running for the exits
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over
and over again Piers and Dudley could only gibber As far as Harry had seen the snake hadnt
done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back
in Uncle Vernons car Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while Piers
was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death But worst of all for Harry at least was Piers
calming down enough to say Harry was talking to it werent you Harry
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry He was so
angry he could hardly speak He managed to say Gocupboardstayno meals before
he collapsed into a chair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy
